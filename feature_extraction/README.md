For these scripts, you will need either opencv or MASt3R. Opencv can be installed as normal, but MASt3R will have to be cloned and installed from it's github.

The `.toml` can be used to make the mast3r and dust3r repos installable in case you're using vscode to run the scripts and package recognition doesn't play nice.
